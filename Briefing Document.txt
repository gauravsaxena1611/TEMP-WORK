Detailed Briefing Document: Application Split and Encryption Compliance
Date: August 1st, 2025 (based on source file timestamp)

Subject: Discussion regarding the administrative vs. functional split of application 180531 (Taiwan functionality) from existing CSI entry PRC Compliance Risk Management (CRC), its impact on encryption requirements, and associated next steps.

Attendees (implied): Tom, April, Rishab, Pritika, Gor, Chira (mentioned as app manager, on leave).

Executive Summary
This meeting primarily focused on determining the correct "inception date" for a new CSI (Computer System Identifier) entry (180531), which is being created to isolate Taiwan-specific functionality currently running under the existing CRC (PRC Compliance Risk Management) CSI. The choice of inception date is critical as it dictates whether the new application falls within the scope of mandatory encryption policies (specifically, if the inception date is before January 2024, encryption is not required by policy).

The core of the discussion revolved around two types of application splits:

Functional Split: Characterized by new development, code changes, and/or significant infrastructure procurement, resulting in a future inception date and requiring adherence to all current production standards, including encryption if applicable.
Administrative Split: Correcting an initial error where multiple logical systems were incorrectly grouped under one CSI. It involves only administrative work (no new development or infrastructure procurement beyond what's already in place) and retains a historical inception date. However, an administrative split implies the new CSI is immediately considered "in production" and must meet all production standards from day one.
After detailed examination, including a screen share of the planned infrastructure changes, the team tentatively concluded that an administrative split is appropriate for the Taiwan functionality. This decision is based on the understanding that the Taiwan application is already a standalone entity in production, with its own segregated infrastructure, and the current changes primarily involve augmenting existing infrastructure (e.g., adding a DMZ zone and new listener) rather than fundamental new development. This classification allows for an earlier (historical) inception date, likely pre-January 2024, thereby exempting it from the current mandatory encryption policy.

Despite this exemption, there was a brief discussion about pursuing database-level encryption as a best practice, but current bandwidth constraints for policy-mandated encryption projects mean this is not a priority for applications outside the scope.

Key Decision: The application split for Taiwan functionality (CSI 180531) will be classified as an administrative split, allowing for an earlier inception date, likely before January 2024, thereby exempting it from current mandatory encryption requirements. This decision must be thoroughly documented with evidence of the chosen inception date.

Main Themes & Important Ideas/Facts
Inception Date and Encryption Scope:
The "inception date" of an application is the primary determinant for whether it falls under the scope of current encryption policies.
Quote: "If inception date is before Jan 24, it is not in scope of encryption as per safety standard."
A new application with a future inception date would be "in scope" for encryption due to its newness and handling of confidential PII.
Types of Application Splits and Their Implications:
Functional Split:Definition: "Functionality in another application is being separated out into its own independent architecture." Requires "changes to code set and/or infrastructure to host the new application."
Inception Date: "Inception date should be in the future."
Compliance: Must go through an SDLC and meet all current production standards upon go-live, including encryption if applicable. Non-compliance would require an exception/gap approval.
Administrative Split:Definition: Correcting an inventory error where "multiple applications... should have been separate applications to begin with." Requires "no additional development or infrastructure procurement... Only administrative work is required."
Inception Date: "Will be registered using the inception date showing when its functionality originally moved to production. That is a historical date."
Compliance: The new CSI is "immediately have a status of production and be required to meet all production standards from the date of approval in CSI." This means all compliance requirements (MFA, info security reviews, etc.) must be in order before the administrative split is registered, or immediate "red camp alerts" will arise.
Quote: "Only administration work, administrative work is required. It will be registered using the inception date showing when its functionality originally moved to production. That is a historical date."
Quote: "But if this is functionality that was added like 10 years ago and and the original application was was implemented in production 15 years ago, then we'd set an an inception date of 10 years ago. Whatever we actually introduce this functionality that we're now splitting off because it should have been its own CSI ID to begin with and we're correcting that problem."
Rationale for Administrative Split (Taiwan functionality):
The Taiwan functionality is an existing application already running in production.
Quote: "So this this is a separate application altogether which we are splitting from this CSI to the uh new dedicated CSI."
The change primarily involves an "infrastructure change," but not new functionality or significant development.
Quote: "We are not adding or removing any functionality. We are just uh putting an application from one infrastructure location to a separate location."
The infrastructure for Taiwan is already segregated/separate.
Quote: "Even the the environment the actual servers application server and database everything is already separate."
The planned changes involve augmenting existing infrastructure (new DMZ zone, new listener for Active MQ) rather than procuring entirely new infrastructure for a new application.
Quote: "It's a subtle nuance, but it sounds like we're augmenting the infrastructure we have... But in order to run separately, we're going to have augment that infrastructure with exactly this new DMZ piece and this new listener piece."
This aligns with the "spirit" of an administrative split, even with some infrastructure augmentation, as the core application functionality is not new.
Quote: "I think the the the spirit of what the guidance is um this sounds like it would to me it would qualify as an administrative split."
Implications of Choosing an Administrative Split:
The new CSI (Taiwan functionality) will be considered "in production" immediately upon registration.
All production requirements must be met by that time, or the application will immediately flag non-compliance issues (e.g., "red camp alerts," MCA failures).
Quote: "As soon as we do that, it's going to have a status of production. It's going to have the original inception date and it's going to start flagging for any problems for that any other production application would have if if it's not meeting all of the requirements."
Recommendation: "Practically speaking I would recommend doing right at the beginning of a month so that unfortunately you have some time between then and the end of the month to deal with all those you know red camp issues and things that are going to come up that were unanticipated before we get to month end reporting."
The choice between administrative and functional split must be based on "what's actually being split," not solely on encryption compliance benefits.
Quote: "Don't make that decision team of admin split versus functional based on what you need to do with the encryption. This needs that that decision needs to be uh based on what's actually being split."
Encryption Policy and Vendor Products:
For vendor products, encryption is often feasible at the database level (e.g., Transparent Database Encryption for SQL databases), even if app-level encryption/tokenization is not supported by the vendor.
Quote: "They might not be able to do app level encryption or uh, tokenization, things like that. But they can very easily do encryption at the database level."
If an application's inception date is before January 2024, it is not currently in scope for mandatory encryption policy, and the company is not actively pursuing best-practice encryption for such applications due to the large volume of applications already requiring it.
Quote: "If the inception date is before uh Jan 24 then they they wouldn't be in scope... We are not doing that at the moment just because from a policy perspective, the volume of uh applications that need to have it done is huge. So, we're targeting those."
Documentation Importance:
Crucial to document the rationale for choosing an administrative split and the specific historical inception date.
Quote: "We'd want to like document all that and probably upload it to the CSI record in case later on somebody questions this so they know exactly what we did."
Quote: "We got to show evidence as to why we chose the date we chose."
CSI creation date is different from the inception date; both need to be handled correctly in the system.
Next Steps & Actions
Confirm Actual Inception Date for Taiwan Functionality:
Determine the exact historical date when the Taiwan application first went live in production under the original CSI.
Action: Rishab and team will investigate by checking with the India development team (Rabi Nanda, etc.) and potentially the infrastructure team for server lifetime/provisioning dates. Product/Program Managers or L2 team members might also have this information.
Concern: The application was part of a broader CRC CSI, which itself was linked to multiple projects (170607, 176046). It's important to pinpoint the specific go-live date for the Taiwan functionality as a standalone entity, even if it was originally grouped.
Prepare for Administrative Split Registration:
Ensure all necessary incremental hardware (DMZ, new listener) is provisioned and in place before the administrative split is formally registered in CSI.
Action: Rishab/team to coordinate infrastructure readiness.
Action: Chira (or whoever is covering for him as App Manager) needs to be made aware to initiate the new CSI registration process, as this will take time.
Document Administrative Split Rationale:
Compile a clear document explaining why an administrative split was chosen (due to existing, segregated functionality and infrastructure augmentation rather than new development).
Action: Rishab/team to prepare this documentation.
Upload this documentation to the new CSI entry and potentially link it to the old CSI entry, if possible within the CSI system.
Communicate Inception Date to April/Encryption Team:
Once the historical inception date is confirmed, communicate it to April. If it's before January 2024, the application will be considered out of scope for mandatory encryption policy.
Action: Rishab/team to inform April.
Initiate Vendor Discussions (Long-Term):
While not immediately mandated, it is prudent to begin discussions with the vendor regarding their capability to support database-level encryption for best practices. This will inform future policy compliance or risk management decisions.
Action: Tom suggested this. April confirmed they are not actively pursuing it for out-of-scope apps but agreed it would be beneficial to understand vendor capabilities.
