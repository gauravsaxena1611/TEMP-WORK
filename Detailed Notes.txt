Here are the detailed notes from the meeting:
Meeting Purpose/Context: The primary purpose of the meeting was to determine the correct inception date for a new application being split off from an existing one, specifically focusing on the Taiwan functionality. This decision is crucial because the inception date directly impacts whether the application falls within the scope of the organization's encryption policy.
Application Background:
• Existing Application: The application is not new; it's an existing system already running in production.
• Scope: It handles confidential Personally Identifiable Information (PII).
• Vendor Product: It is a vendor-provided product, and the team has limited knowledge of how encryption might affect it.
• Infrastructure Change: The "new" aspect of this split is primarily an infrastructure change, not new development or functionality.
• Functional Split Origin: The new CSI (180531) is a functional split from an existing CSI entry (PRC compliance risk management, 170607).
• Taiwan Functionality: The application in question specifically pertains to the Taiwan region, and this entire Taiwan-specific application is being split into a new, dedicated CSI ID.
• Existing Segregation: The environment, including application servers and databases for this particular application, is already physically separate. When the new CSI ID is created, this existing infrastructure association will be moved to the new app ID.
• New Infrastructure Augmentation: While the core is existing, there are new infrastructure requirements, including the procurement and building of an upgraded environment under the new CSI ID. This involves adding a new DMZ zone, an Active MQ, and a new listener component, along with a J agent software from the vendor. This is considered an augmentation of existing infrastructure, not a complete overhaul.
Key Concepts: Functional Split vs. Administrative Split The discussion heavily revolved around two ways to characterize an application split, each with different implications for the inception date:
1. Functional Split:
    ◦ Defined as functionality in another application being separated into its own independent architecture.
    ◦ Requires new development, changes to code and/or infrastructure to host the new application.
    ◦ A project may be required to perform this work.
    ◦ The inception date should be in the future (when it goes live).
    ◦ If determined to be a functional split and the inception date is 2026 (as initially thought for new applications), it would be in scope for encryption.
2. Administrative Split:
    ◦ Defined as correcting an inventory error where multiple logical systems were incorrectly grouped under one CSI ID.
    ◦ The application evolved as a separate, distinct physical entity from the original application.
    ◦ Requires no additional development or infrastructure procurement for separation; only administrative work is needed.
    ◦ The application is registered using the inception date when its functionality originally moved to production (a historical date).
    ◦ The new CSI ID will immediately have a status of "production" from the date of approval in CSI.
    ◦ It will be required to meet all production standards immediately, meaning it will start flagging for any non-compliance issues (e.g., MFA, info security reviews). This necessitates ensuring all requirements are met before the split is registered.
    ◦ Recommendation: If opting for an administrative split, it's advisable to do it at the beginning of a month to allow time to address any unanticipated "red camp alerts" or "MCA failures" before month-end reporting. It is also recommended to get incremental hardware provisioned and in place before the admin split is affected.
Decision on Split Type & Inception Date:
• The general consensus leaned towards characterizing the split as an administrative split, primarily because the Taiwan functionality existed, was already logically separated, and the infrastructure changes are seen as augmentation rather than new development.
• Rationale for Administrative Split: The application's infrastructure (servers, database) is already separate. While new infrastructure (DMZ, listener, Active MQ) is being added, it is for augmenting the existing setup to run separately, not creating a brand new application. The spirit of the guidance suggests this qualifies.
• Impact on Inception Date: By choosing an administrative split, the team can use an earlier inception date – specifically, the date when the Taiwan functionality originally went live in production. This date for the Taiwan functionality is believed to be in 2022.
• Encryption Policy Avoidance: An inception date before January 2024 means the application will not be in scope for the current encryption policy. This is a significant outcome of pursuing the administrative split with a historical inception date.
• Crucial Documentation: It is vital to document precisely why an administrative split was chosen and provide evidence for the selected historical inception date to avoid arbitrary dating and potential compliance issues. The diagram showing existing and new infrastructure components should be uploaded as documentation if possible.
Encryption Policy & Vendor Considerations:
• No Mandatory Encryption (due to inception date): Since the administrative split aims for an inception date before January 2024, the application will not be formally required to comply with the current encryption policy.
• Vendor Capabilities: The team acknowledged that it's a vendor product. While application-level encryption or tokenization might be difficult for vendors, database-level encryption (e.g., Transparent Database Encryption for SQL databases) is typically feasible.
• Best Practice vs. Mandate: Even if not policy-mandated due to the inception date, it was suggested to pursue database-level encryption with the vendor as a "best practice". However, this is not currently being prioritized due to the high volume of other applications that are in scope for encryption.
• Future Discussions: It is considered prudent to initiate discussions with the vendor about their capabilities to meet desired encryption requirements, even if not immediately mandated, to understand future possibilities.
Key Decisions:
• The team has decided to proceed with an administrative split.
• This will allow them to use an earlier inception date (before January 2024), which means the application will not be in scope for encryption policy.
• The exact earlier inception date, when the Taiwan application first went live in production (believed to be 2022), needs to be verified.
• Documentation of the rationale for this decision is paramount.
Next Steps/Action Items:
1. Identify the Exact Inception Date:
    ◦ Determine the actual production go-live date for the Taiwan functionality.
    ◦ Resources to check: India development team (Rabi Nanda and others involved in initial development), infrastructure team (for total lifetime of infrastructure). KL or a product/program manager might also have this information.
    ◦ Once the date is confirmed, it will be communicated to April, as her decision on encryption depends on it.
2. CSI Registration:
    ◦ Proceed with registering the new CSI ID.
    ◦ Crucially, ensure all historical conversations and documentation supporting the administrative split and the chosen inception date are attached to the new CSI record.
    ◦ The CSI creation date and the inception date for the application should be recorded separately in the system.
3. Vendor Engagement (Future):
    ◦ Begin discussions with the vendor to understand their capabilities for meeting desired encryption requirements, even if not currently mandated.
4. Accountability for CSI Registration:
    ◦ Chiag, the app manager, is accountable, but is on planned leave. A note will be sent to him to initiate this process.
