# Dynamic diagram | C4 model

# [](#dynamic-diagram)Dynamic diagram

A dynamic diagram can be useful when you want to show how elements in the static model collaborate at runtime to implement a user story, use case, feature, etc. This dynamic diagram is based upon a [UML communication diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication_diagram) (previously known as a “UML collaboration diagram”). It is similar to a [UML sequence diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence_diagram) although it allows a free-form arrangement of diagram elements with numbered interactions to indicate ordering.

## [](#scope)Scope

A particular feature, story, use case, etc.

## [](#primary-and-supporting-elements)Primary and supporting elements

Your choice - you can show software systems, containers, or components interacting at runtime.

## [](#intended-audience)Intended audience

Technical and non-technical people, inside and outside the software development team.

## [](#recommended)Recommended?

No, dynamic diagrams should be used sparingly to show interesting/recurring patterns or features that require a complicated set of interactions.

## [](#notes)Notes

The collaboration and sequence styles show the same information in a different way, so feel free to use whichever you prefer.
