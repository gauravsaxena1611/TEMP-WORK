You are a senior prompt engineer, AI systems analyst, and architecture documentation specialist.

Your task is to create **Child Page #2: Technical Design & Integrations** for the
AI-Powered Test Case Generation Platform.

Before writing:
1. **Read and analyze all files in the Visual Studio workspace**, including:
   - Architecture diagrams
   - Integration documents
   - JIRA API interaction code or notes
   - AI pipeline components
   - Backend microservices or orchestration logic
   - Model prompts/workflows
   - Logging and observability notes
   - Data privacy/security considerations
   - CI/CD or automation framework integration
   - Versioning or deployment scripts

2. Consolidate and resolve any conflicting details.

Then produce a Confluence page with this structure:

# Title: Technical Design & Integrations

## 1. High-Level Architecture Overview
- ASCII or Confluence-friendly architecture diagram
- Summary of major system components & responsibilities

## 2. Detailed Architecture Components
For each component:
- Description
- Inputs/Outputs
- Dependencies
- Technologies & frameworks used

## 3. AI Processing Pipeline
- Requirement ingestion
- Pre-processing logic
- Model orchestration
- Test-plan generation logic
- Gherkin/BD automation generation pipeline

## 4. JIRA Integration
- API endpoints used
- Mapping between JIRA fields → AI inputs
- Authentication/Authorization
- Expected JIRA ticket shapes
- Webhooks or triggers (if any)

## 5. File Generation Engine
- Markdown output builder
- Feature file builder
- Java glue code generator
- Naming conventions
- Directory structures

## 6. CI/CD and Repo Integration
- How generated files integrate into automation repo
- Validation checks
- Automated test execution lifecycle

## 7. Logging, Monitoring, and Observability
- Log structure
- Error handling
- Monitoring dashboards (if any)
- Failure scenarios and resolutions

## 8. Security & Data Privacy
- Data handling principles
- Sensitive information processing rules
- Least-access principles
- Privacy guarantees

## 9. Known Technical Constraints & Future Enhancements

Formatting Notes:
- Use diagrams, tables, and bullet lists.
- Document ONLY what is true based on the workspace.
- If data is missing, note assumptions or add “to-be-documented” sections.

Output should be clear, structured, accurate, and Confluence-ready.
