# [](#deployment-diagram)Deployment diagram

A deployment diagram allows you to illustrate how instances of software systems and/or containers in the static model are deployed on to the infrastructure within a given **deployment environment** (e.g. production, staging, development, etc). It’s based upon a [UML deployment diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deployment_diagram).

A **deployment node** represents where an instance of a software system/container is running; perhaps physical infrastructure (e.g. a physical server or device), virtualised infrastructure (e.g. IaaS, PaaS, a virtual machine), containerised infrastructure (e.g. a Docker container), an execution environment (e.g. a database server, Java EE web/application server, Microsoft IIS), etc. Deployment nodes can be nested.

You may also want to include **infrastructure nodes** such as DNS services, load balancers, firewalls, etc.

Feel free to use icons provided by Amazon Web Services, Azure, etc to complement your deployment diagrams … just make sure any icons you use are included in your diagram key/legend.
