# Now lets move to the next step. generate detailed confluence page for step 6. Regression Tests, remember to follow our structure. and refer all teh details where possible from step 1,2 3, 4 \& 5. Make this page as much elaborated and descriptive as much possible as this is our main task. try to use reference form all teh previous steps and templates.

Certainly! Below is a **fully detailed, highly structured Confluence page draft for Step 6: Regression Tests** in your springboot-copilot-test-playbook.
It is comprehensive, heavily cross-references all earlier steps/templates, includes best practices, detailed instructions, validation/refinement checks, and sample templates/prompts for automation coverage and tracking.

# Step 6: Regression Test Suite Construction


***

## 1. Overview

**Purpose:**
Regression testing ensures that code changes or enhancements do not break or degrade existing and previously tested functionality. This step sets up a maintainable regression test suite that integrates unit, integration, and API tests, and links directly to business workflows, data models, and prior testing artifacts for full change assurance.

**When:**
Every sprint/release and after major code changes. Regression should be continuously maintained as part of the CI/CD pipeline, becoming broader and more valuable over time.

**Outcome:**

- A living suite of automated tests covering all critical, customer-facing, and risk-prone workflows.
- Tests are mapped to workflows, endpoints, entities, and past defects for traceability.
- Reporting, flakiness tracking, and actionable feedback are delivered to the team.

**References:**

- All Step 1 templates (FunctionalWorkflow, DataModel, ProjectInfo, TeamGoals).
- Step 2 setup (repeatable/isolatable environment).
- Step 3 (unit test catalog and coverage), Step 4 (integration points/scenarios), Step 5 (API endpoints/scenarios).
- All previous test coverage reports and coverage gaps.

## 2. Inputs \& Dependencies

| Artifact | Relevance to Regression Testing |
| :-- | :-- |
| ProjectInfoTemplate.md | Core project scope and risk areas |
| FunctionalWorkflowTemplate.md | All business flows to be covered by regression |
| DataModelTemplate.md | Key entities and relations for persistent regression coverage |
| TeamGoalsTemplate.md | Priority areas, required coverage %, defect leakage tolerance |
| Environment-setup.md | Scripts and configs for consistent test runs |
| UnitTestTargetsTemplate.md | All unit test classes for regression inclusion |
| IntegrationTestTargetsTemplate.md | Multi-component coverage to fold into regression |
| API Test Targets \& Scenarios | HTTP/contract guarantees for external and internal clients |
| Coverage Reports (.md, HTML/XML) | Baseline, track gaps, regressions-in-coverage after changes |
| Defect Log / Bug Templates | Ensure fixes are regression tested and tracked |
| RegressionTestSuite.md | Canonical test suite list for execution and traceability |


***

## 3. Step-by-Step Guide

### 3.1 Define Regression Test Coverage Scope

- Review **FunctionalWorkflowTemplate.md** and map every listed business flow to at least one automated regression test.
- Use **TeamGoalsTemplate.md** to prioritize core, high-risk, or recently changed features, and include past defect-prone areas (via bug log).
- Confirm entity/workflow linkages using **DataModelTemplate.md** and **ProjectInfoTemplate.md**.


#### Prompt

> "For all high-priority workflows in FunctionalWorkflowTemplate.md, list the tests (unit, integration, API) that must be included in the regression suite, referencing coverage/gap reports."

***

### 3.2 Collate \& Organize Test Classes

- **Unit tests:** Select all critical logic and boundary case tests from Step 3 to be rerun with every code change.
- **Integration tests:** Ensure service→repository, service→API, and cross-component tests (from Step 4) are included, especially for workflows that traverse multiple modules.
- **API tests:** Integrate all endpoint success, error, and security/validation checks.
- **Past defect tests:** For every fixed bug, ensure a non-regression test exists and is linked to the issue number.


#### Prompt

> "Generate a markdown table capturing regression test assets, including their source (unit/integration/API), mapped workflow, and priority."

***

### 3.3 Automate Regression Suite Execution

- Set up or update your CI/CD pipeline to run the regression suite on every pull request, scheduled run, or manual trigger.
- Ensure the suite can be run locally with a single command, matching the CI environment as closely as possible.
- Use Spring profiles, Testcontainers, in-memory DBs, and external stubs for full environment uniformity.

**Reference:**

- environment-setup.md for build/test configs
- test-dependencies.md for stable tool/runner versions

***

### 3.4 Regression Test Suite Tracking and Documentation

- Populate **RegressionTestSuite.md** with:
    - Test name/class \& source
    - Covered workflows/scenarios
    - Dependencies (entities, APIs, services)
    - Last status (pass/fail/skipped/flaky)
    - Change/issue linkage
    - Owner/maintainer


#### Template (see Section 4.1)

- Commit to regular updates and reviews after every feature, refactor, or bug fix.

***

### 3.5 Validate Regression Suite Health

- **Monitor pass/fail rates:** Alert on new failures or chronic flakiness (track root causes).
- **Coverage regression:** Use unit/integration/api-test-coverage.md files to spot any decrease in code/path coverage.
- **Defect leakage:** For any production bug, add missing regression cases before closing.
- **Traceability check:** Every workflow, endpoint, and major data entity is covered by at least one regression test.


#### Prompt

> "Update RegressionTestSuite.md with the latest run results from the CI pipeline, marking new failures, new regressions, or flakiness."

***

### 3.6 Refine \& Expand Suite Continuously

- **Onboard new requirements/workflows:** Add test cases/scenarios when new business flows are defined or changed in Step 1.
- **Retrofit for missed bugs:** After every incident, add a regression test.
- **Retire obsolete cases:** Remove or mark deprecated tests as system evolves.
- Review coverage and update suite at every major release or milestone.

## 6. Validation \& Refinement

**Comprehensive Validation Techniques:**

- **Full suite run** in CI after every change; immediate notification of failures.
- **Coverage analysis:** No critical workflow, endpoint, or entity may lack regression coverage.
- **Defect log mapping:** Ensure any new prod bug triggers a tracked and automated regression test.
- **Peer/lead review** for every new/changed scenario (esp. for high-priority workflows).
- **Flaky tests triaged:** Monitored, root-caused, or temporarily quarantined but never ignored.
- **Test retirement:** Remove or archive obsolete/deprecated tests after system changes are validated.
- **Documentation synchronized:** Tracking table, scenarios, and links always current.
