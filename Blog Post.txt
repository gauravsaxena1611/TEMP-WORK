We Listened In on a Private Corporate Data Strategy Meeting. Here Are 4 Surprising Truths We Learned.

Introduction: The Illusion of Order

We often imagine that large, successful corporations run on a foundation of flawless data. We picture a world of seamless, automated systems where information is always perfectly accurate and instantly available. The reality, however, is far more complex, human, and fraught with debate.

Behind the curtain of polished dashboards and official reports, technical and compliance experts engage in constant, high-stakes negotiations about what it means for data to be "right." We discovered that the day-to-day reality of corporate data is a constant negotiation between what is auditable and what is ideal, between meeting deadlines and preventing silent, catastrophic failures. This post distills the most surprising and impactful takeaways from a candid, internal discussion among these experts, revealing the hidden debates that truly shape how data flows inside a major corporation.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


1. "Completeness" Doesn't Mean "Correctness": The Core Data Dilemma

The central point of tension was the crucial difference between data completeness and data accuracy. In simple terms, a system can report that it successfully received and processed 1,000 records, satisfying the check for "completeness." However, that same system may have no idea if the content of those 1,000 records is corrupted, truncated, or inconsistent with the original source.

The debate highlighted two opposing worldviews, rooted not in negligence, but in formal governance. The use-case delivery lead argued that technology's responsibility ends with confirming receipt based on control information, like header and footer counts. This is because, under their framework, accuracy is not a technical control. As he stated, "Accuracy is something which is not tech can confirm. Accuracy is something which is owned by the business." On the other side, the platform architect pushed for a deeper, record-by-record reconciliation to proactively ensure data integrity before it reaches the business.

"see completeness and consistency is what we We normally show is we have received 100 record we have processed 100 records and 100 records are available now 100 for junk we have processed the junk it's a junk in junk out"

This highlights a classic conflict between operationalizing policy and engineering for resilience. The gap between technical validation (Did we get everything?) and actual data quality (Is what we got right?) is where significant business risks can hide. More profoundly, a key speaker later pointed out that the real danger isn't just "garbage in, garbage out." It’s when "it's the right one [in] but garbage out because something went wrong" in the process itself. This is where business risks hide in plain sight.

2. Audit-Proof vs. Error-Proof: The Pressure of Compliance Shapes Everything

This risk is amplified by a second surprising truth: the pressure to be "audit-proof" often outweighs the desire to be "error-proof." The teams were operating under a time-crunched "consent order" (a legally binding agreement to fix regulatory issues), narrowing their focus to meeting the exact letter of the law as defined by official "EDO guidelines" (the internal rules from their Enterprise Data Office).

One argument from a delivery lead was a methodical breakdown of their mandated "10 CDGP controls." He contended that only control #7, "Completeness and timeliness of the data transfer," applied to tech, and its definition was narrowly focused on record counts and SLAs—nothing more. Adding un-mandated reconciliation, he argued, introduces risk to tight timelines. In contrast, a platform lead countered that failing to be proactive could lead to being "slapped for something that been overlooked."

This philosophical divide was perfectly captured by a compliance function lead who defined his team's role as data provisioning, not data validation. "The front end gives us garbage data. Look at the garbage data. Front end gives us good data. Look at the good data. Right? The data accuracy responsibility is the front line."

"Doing something extra does not harm. I agree. But we need to abide by all the deliverables, the documentation, everything for the audit tomorrow. So that is where I'm little little I would hesitating in proceeding as long as the guidelines says..."

This reveals that technical architecture in a regulated environment is a direct response to the high-stakes reality of satisfying auditors. Every decision exposes the tension between accruing compliance debt versus technical debt.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3. Just Moving Data Can Make You a "Distributor"—And That's a Huge Deal

A surprisingly complex debate emerged around internal data governance roles, specifically the difference between being an "Authoritative Redistributor" (AR) versus a "Licensed Application" (LA). These aren't just jargon; the designation determines the level of responsibility and the number of controls a team must implement. Becoming an AR, even if you are just passing data along, comes with immense regulatory and operational overhead.

This was not an abstract discussion. A lead architect explained his team’s active strategic battle to get their new "data proxy" service classified as a lightweight LA. The goal was simple efficiency: receive a dataset once and distribute it to multiple internal systems, avoiding redundant pipelines. However, this logical act could force them to become an AR, subjecting them to a host of stringent data governance rules they were trying to avoid.

"...erm is becoming an AR for the data...you need to be extra careful because now you are the distributor of the data"

This illustrates that data architecture in a large firm is as much about navigating internal policy and ownership as it is about technology. The seemingly simple act of sharing data internally is fraught with strategic decisions about risk and responsibility, where the most efficient technical solution might be unworkable from a governance perspective.

4. The Most Dangerous Failures are the Silent Ones

The most powerful argument for deeper data reconciliation came from a single, concrete example of a "silent failure." It was the mic-drop moment that validated the need to look beyond narrow, audit-focused checks. A speaker described a scenario where a system is designed to receive data and write it to an Oracle database.

The problem arises when an incoming data field contains 6,000 characters, but the corresponding database column can only store 4,000. If the system's error handling is coded improperly, a catastrophic but invisible failure can occur. The system could silently truncate the data, write the partial, corrupted record to the database, and report the entire process as a "success." The row counts would match, the timeliness SLA would be met, but the data would be fundamentally damaged without anyone knowing. This is the ultimate example of "right one in, garbage out."

"...we coded it we designed it to consume the data and put into Oracle worker to field and that can take only 4,000 characters all of a sudden one particular record got 6,000 characters Oracle is supposed to fail...[but if coded incorrectly] you wrote the partial record into the database and the whole process has become successful...now your count checks are valid timeliness is valid but accuracy is not valid anymore right"

This one example perfectly encapsulates the entire debate. It demonstrates that without robust, granular checks that validate the actual content, processes can appear perfectly healthy on dashboards while introducing critical, invisible errors. The business may not discover this data corruption for weeks, if at all, highlighting the profound risk of prioritizing superficial, auditable checks over true data integrity.

Conclusion: Data is a Conversation

Data integrity within a large organization is not a static, solved problem. It is a continuous, high-stakes conversation about risk, responsibility, and resources, driven by the relentless tension between pragmatic, compliance-driven delivery and the pursuit of robust, ideal engineering. The clean, orderly systems we imagine are the end result of these messy, necessary debates.

For anyone involved in designing, managing, or auditing business processes, this conversation is a critical reminder that data governance is not a set of static rules, but a dynamic and human negotiation of risk. The next time a service you use has a glitch, will you wonder if it was a simple bug, or the outcome of a complex but necessary debate about what it truly means for data to be "right"?
