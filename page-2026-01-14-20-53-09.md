## [](#should-the-lines-represent-dependencies-or-data-flow)Should the lines represent dependencies or data flow?

This is your choice. Sometimes diagrams work better showing dependency relationships (e.g. uses, reads from, etc), and sometimes data flow (e.g. customer update events) works better. Whichever you choose, make sure that the description of the line matches the direction of the arrow.

It’s also worth remembering that most relationships can be expressed either way, and the more explicit you can be, the better. For example, describing a relationship as “sends customer update events to” can be more descriptive than simply “customer update events”.

## [](#will-the-diagrams-become-outdated-quickly)Will the diagrams become outdated quickly?

Due to the hierarchical nature of the C4 model, each diagram will change at a different rate.

-   **System context diagram**: In most cases, the system context diagram will change very slowly, as this describes the landscape that the software system is operating within.
-   **Container diagram**: Unless you’re building a software system that makes heavy use of microservices or serverless lambdas/functions/etc, the container diagram will also change relatively slowly.
-   **Component diagram**: For any software system under active development, the component diagrams may change frequently as the team adds, removes or restructures the code into cohesive components.
-   **Code diagram**: The level 4 code (e.g. class) diagrams will potentially become outdated very quickly if the codebase is under active development. For this reason, the recommendation is to (1) not create them at all or (2) generate them on-demand using tooling such as your IDE.

Of course, the above only applies when you are creating your C4 diagrams by hand. Automatically generating your diagrams will ensure they are kept up to date and reflect reality at all times. Possible approaches to do this include:

-   **System landscape/context diagrams**: Using existing system/service catalogs (e.g. Backstage, ServiceNow, etc) as a source of data for identifying software systems and relationships.
-   **Container diagrams**: Parsing log files or using OpenTelemetry data as a source of data for identifying microservices and relationships.
-   **Component diagrams**: Static analysis/reverse-engineering of code as a source of data for identifying components and their relationships.
-   **Deployment diagrams**: Parsing “infrastructure as code” definitions (e.g. Terraform, CloudFormation, etc) or reverse-engineering cloud environment configuration as a source of data for identifying deployment elements.
