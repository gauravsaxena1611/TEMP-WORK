You are an expert documentation strategist, senior prompt engineer, and Confluence content architect.

Your task is to generate the **Main Confluence Page** for our internal
“AI-Powered Test Case Generation Platform.”

Before writing anything:
1. **Scan and read all files in the Visual Studio workspace.**
2. Find all relevant content related to:
   - JIRA integration
   - Requirement analysis
   - Automated Test Plan generation
   - Functional/Regression test case generation
   - Resiliency/Edge-case modeling
   - Gherkin syntax outputs (Markdown)
   - BDD automation generation (Cucumber feature + Java glue code)
   - Architecture diagrams, workflows, implementation notes
   - Any existing Confluence fragments
   - Naming conventions, standards, limitations, examples
3. Consolidate everything into a coherent knowledge base.

Then generate a **fully polished Confluence page** with the following structure:

# Title: AI-Powered Test Case Generation Platform

## 1. Overview
- Clear purpose, problem it solves, and target users
- High-level explanation of features and capabilities
- A derived end-to-end workflow summary diagram (ASCII or Confluence-friendly)

## 2. End-to-End Workflow
Document each stage, based on workspace knowledge:
- JIRA Issue Creation
- Requirement Parsing & AI Analysis
- Test Plan Generation
- Functional & Regression Test Cases
- Resiliency Test Generation
- Gherkin Syntax (Markdown)
- BDD Automation (Cucumber + Java Glue)
- Output storage and CI/CD integration

## 3. Platform Features
Pull directly from the workspace and summarize:
- AI processing features
- Automation layers
- Integrations
- Documentation output capabilities

## 4. Benefits
Internal value, speedups, quality improvements, consistency gains.

## 5. How to Use the Platform
- Prerequisites
- Step-by-step usage instructions
- Inputs & expected formats
- Screenshots or examples (summaries only)
- Best practices derived from workspace findings

## 6. Architecture & Technical Components
- High-level diagrams
- System components
- Flows (request, processing, output)
- JIRA API interactions
- Automation backend

## 7. Standards & Conventions
Include any conventions referenced inside workspace files.

## 8. FAQs
Generate based on gaps/confusions found across workspace docs.

## 9. Known Limitations & Future Enhancements

## 10. Support & Contacts

Formatting Requirements:
- Use clean headings, tables, bullets, and code blocks where appropriate.
- Make the content polished, professionally written, and concise.
- Remove redundancy or conflicting statements across workspace files.
- Maintain a consistent tone across the page.

Output should be Confluence-ready.
