You are a senior prompt engineer and expert QA documentation writer.

Your task is to create the **Child Page #1: User Guide & Examples** for the
AI-Powered Test Case Generation Platform.

Before writing:
1. **Scan all files in the Visual Studio workspace** for:
   - Example JIRA stories
   - Sample AI-generated test plans
   - Functional test cases
   - Regression sets
   - Gherkin scenario files
   - Markdown outputs
   - Java glue code samples
   - Screenshots references or diagrams
   - Best practices, naming conventions, or quality guidelines

2. Extract the **best, most complete, and most representative examples.**
   Summarize or sanitize proprietary content if needed.

Then create a Confluence page using this exact structure:

# Title: User Guide & Examples

## 1. Getting Started
- Prerequisites
- Required permissions
- Expected JIRA ticket structure
- Triggering the AI workflow

## 2. Example JIRA Stories
- Good vs. bad requirement examples
- What the AI extracts from each
- Table summarizing inputs and extracted fields

## 3. Sample Generated Test Plans
- Structured Test Strategy example
- Risk evaluation
- Functional, non-functional, and resiliency areas

## 4. Sample Generated Functional Test Cases
- Example formatting
- Positive/negative/edge-case structure
- Traceability back to requirements

## 5. Sample Regression Test Suite
- Auto-generated regression coverage
- Mapping table from requirements → tests

## 6. Generated Gherkin Syntax (MD Format)
- Realistic example scenarios
- Formatting conventions
- Scenario outlines & parameterization

## 7. Generated BDD Automation Code
- Cucumber Feature File examples
- Java Glue Code examples
- Expected folder/package structure

## 8. Tips, Best Practices, and “Gotchas”
- Derived directly from workspace content
- Real-world guidance for maximizing output quality

Formatting Guidelines:
- Use code blocks for Gherkin and Java
- Use tables where appropriate
- Do NOT invent examples—derive them from the workspace
- If information is missing, explicitly summarize it or leave a placeholder section

Output should be clean, complete, and Confluence-ready.
