The discussion revolves around classifying a system split as either a functional split or an administrative split, which significantly impacts its inception date and, consequently, its encryption policy compliance. A functional split entails new development and a future inception date, making it subject to current encryption requirements. Conversely, an administrative split means an existing system is simply being re-categorized in inventory, allowing it to retain its original, historical inception date and potentially fall outside current encryption mandates. The team is trying to determine the correct classification to ensure regulatory compliance and avoid issues with a new CSI ID for a Taiwan-specific application. They also discuss whether to pursue vendor-provided database-level encryption as a best practice, even if not strictly required by policy based on the inception date.
