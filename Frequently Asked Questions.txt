Frequently Asked Questions about Application Splits and Encryption Policy
What is the main issue being discussed regarding the application in question?
The central issue revolves around determining the correct "inception date" for a new CSI (Common System Inventory) entry, which is being split off from an existing application. This inception date is crucial because it directly impacts whether the new application falls within the scope of a mandatory encryption policy, specifically if its inception date is on or after January 2024. The team is trying to decide whether the split is a "functional split" (new development, future inception date, subject to encryption) or an "administrative split" (correcting an existing misclassification, historical inception date, potentially exempt from encryption).

What is the difference between an "administrative split" and a "functional split"?
An administrative split occurs when a separate, distinct physical entity (application) has always existed and been in production, but it was incorrectly grouped under a single application ID in the inventory. This split primarily involves administrative work to correct the inventory, not new development or significant infrastructure procurement. In this case, the application retains its original, historical inception date, which is when its functionality first moved to production. The key consequence is that as soon as the administrative split is registered, the new CSI ID is considered immediately in production and must meet all production standards.

A functional split, on the other hand, involves separating existing functionality into its own independent architecture, which requires new development, changes to code and/or infrastructure, and often a new project. Because it's essentially new development, the inception date for a functional split will be in the future, typically when it goes live. Applications resulting from a functional split are subject to current policies, including the encryption mandate if their inception date is January 2024 or later.

Why is the inception date so critical for this application?
The inception date is critical because it determines the application's compliance with the encryption policy. If the inception date is before January 2024, the application is not "in scope" for the mandatory encryption policy. If the inception date is January 2024 or later, the application is in scope and must comply with encryption requirements or obtain an exception/gap approval.

What are the implications of choosing an administrative split for the new CSI ID?
If an administrative split is chosen, the new CSI ID will retain an earlier, historical inception date (e.g., when the Taiwan-specific functionality first went live in 2022). This would likely place it out of scope for the current encryption policy. However, the critical implication is that the moment the administrative split is registered, the new CSI ID is immediately considered in "production status" and must meet all production standards. This means all associated infrastructure, security reviews, and other compliance requirements must be in order before the split is formally recorded, or the application will immediately flag non-compliance issues.

How does the vendor aspect complicate the encryption discussion?
The application in question uses a vendor product. The team initially discusses whether vendor products have an exception to encryption requirements or if the vendor's refusal to encrypt could be a barrier. However, it's clarified that most vendor products, even if they don't support application-level encryption or tokenization, can typically support database-level encryption (like Transparent Database Encryption for SQL databases), which is sufficient for compliance. The immediate concern is to sort out the inception date first, as that could potentially exempt the application entirely from the encryption policy based on its age.

What is the current status of the application and its infrastructure, and how does that influence the split decision?
The Taiwan-specific functionality is already running in production under the existing CSI ID, and its environment (servers, databases) is already segregated. The plan involves "augmenting" the existing infrastructure with new components like a DMZ zone and a new listener for data communication, but no fundamental changes to the core application functionality. This suggests that an administrative split might be appropriate, as it's not "new development" in terms of functionality. The team believes this infrastructure augmentation still aligns with the "spirit" of an administrative split, but it would need thorough documentation.

What are the immediate next steps after this discussion?
The immediate next steps are to:

Determine the precise inception date for the Taiwan-specific application. This involves checking with the India team involved in its initial development and potentially reviewing infrastructure logs for the "go-live" date (likely 2022).
Document the rationale for choosing the administrative split and the specific inception date, especially if it's a historical date. This documentation should be uploaded to both the new and old CSI entries.
Prepare for immediate production status: If an administrative split is chosen, ensure all production requirements (infrastructure, security, etc.) are met before the new CSI ID is registered to avoid immediate red flags and compliance issues.
Initiate new CSI registration: Once the inception date and split type are confirmed, proceed with registering the new CSI ID.
Will encryption still be pursued if the application is exempt due to an earlier inception date?
Currently, if the application's inception date is before January 2024, it will not be required to meet the encryption policy. While it would be a "best practice" to pursue database-level encryption from the vendor, the organization is not mandating it for applications out of scope due to the high volume of applications that are in scope. However, there is an agreement that it would be prudent to begin discussions with the vendor about their capability to meet desired encryption requirements for future understanding, even if not immediately mandated.
